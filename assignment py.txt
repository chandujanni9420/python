- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
a=[12,75,150,180,145,525,50]
b=[]
for i in a:
if i>150:
if i>500:
continue
if i%5==0:
b,append(i)
print b

(75,150,145)
